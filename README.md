# The Sims 4 Tools

A big set ot methods and tools which I use for my mods.

Please don't use it for your mods. There are other, better documented and more stable libraries available.

## Compatibility
This mod is not compatible with some other mods.

#### TS4 Mods hosted on MTS or as TS4T on GitHub
Most of my mods from MTS require the 'TS4-TS4T' and 'TS4-Library-for-TS4T'.
They may make use of another library with similar features in case one is installed.
The 'TS4T' mods are not open source and not meant for further distribution.

#### TS4 Mods hosted with source code  on GitHub
My other mods hosted on GitHub are fully supported, are open source and issues can be tracked with the GitHub issue tracker.
Also they don't suffer from any compatibility issues.
According to MTS something within https://modthesims.info/rubrics/3892/637/TS4/ applies to them so staff suggests that you don't use them.
